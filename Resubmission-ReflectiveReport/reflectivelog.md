Log start, start the third assignment. Download the assignment description, read and deep understand the description of the task.

#### 2017.02.02-2017.02.04
Start to search for some relevant literatures and articles about the methods or techniques that in large scale requirments engineer domain. Then read these literatures and articles, here are some articles that I have already readed. Following the reading list:

1. Hatton S. Choosing the right prioritisation method[C]//Software Engineering, 2008. ASWEC 2008. 19th Australian Conference on. IEEE, 2008: 517-526.

#### 2017.02.05
After read all of these literatures and articles, We decide to select two articles as our key research Objects. We need to understand and implement the methods/techniques mentioned in these articles.
The two articles we selected are:
1. Hatton S. Choosing the right prioritisation method[C]//Software Engineering, 2008. ASWEC 2008. 19th Australian Conference on. IEEE, 2008: 517-526.
2. och Dag J N, Regnell B, Gervasi V, et al. A linguistic-engineering approach to large-scale requirements management[J]. IEEE software, 2005, 22(1): 32-39.

#### 2017.02.06
Start to implement the MoSCoW method into the part of requirement of the 208 Course Management System requirements. 

#### 2017.02.07
Document the result and execution process of MoSCoW method into report.

#### 2017.02.08
Write the lesson learned from the implementation. 
Document it into report.

#### 2017.02.09
Start to implement the linguistic-engineering approach into the part of requirement of the 208 Course Management System requirements.

#### 2017.02.10
Document the result and execution process of linguistic-engineering approach into report.

#### 2017.02.11
Write the lesson learned from the implementation. 
Document it into report.

#### 2017.02.12-2017.02.15
Read more articles which is similar with these two articles. Compare their differences. Draw useful information from these articles, in order to enhance our understanding of the two methods/approaches. The articles list will be followed.
