## Activities

##### 2017.1.10
Log start. Download the description of release planning assignment and discuss with other students about the requirements. As we know that, the number of requirements are 208. I will read and understand these requirements. And there are some repeated requirements, I will find them out and abandoned them.

##### 2017.1.11
I will check the "customer value analysis for release planning assignment" in course discussion forum on the itslearning. These requirements are from different students' opinion. Different students play different roles, the roles including developer, old engineer student, old non-engineering student, new student, teacher, administrator and manager. I will divide the requirements into several different parts according the different roles.

##### 2017.1.12-2017.1.18
Deeply understand these requirements, and communicate with those who write these requirements.

##### 2017.1.19-2017.1.23
Check the "prioritization methods" in the course discussion forum. I will summary and list some methods that can be optional for my release planning. And also read some relative articles and papers to have deep understanding.

##### 2017.1.24
Analysis the tools and methods that we have found for release planning. Make a decision about the methods and tools that we will select for our project. 
Decision: MoScoW and theme-based release planning methods.

##### 2017.1.25
Analysis the method that we have already selected. And try to get some helpful information from the presentation. 

###### Tolls analysis-1-MoSCOW 
MoSCoW sorting method is proposed by DSDM Consortium. MoSCoW's approach is when doing iteration Planning, the requirements are divided into four categories. They are M (Must Have), S (Should Have), C (Could Have) and W (Won't Have It Right Now). 
1. M (Must Have), for iteration goal, no delivery can not meet the standard.
2. S (Should Have) for iteration goal, there are still alternatives, even if there is no delivery, does not affect the matter.
3. C (Could Have) for iteration goal is not directly related, if the delivery can be extra points, but even ignore the matter will not affect the matter.
4. W (Won't Have It Right Now) has nothing to do with iteration goal.

###### Tolls analysis-2-Theme-based release planning 
This method is a good method that will help the project manager to tap hidden business opportunities. Trade-off solutions are balancing their preference between individual and theme-based planning objectives. There are two-staged solution approach. For phase 1, the existing Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) is adapted. For phase 2, is to explore two alternative ways to select among the (potentially large number) of Pareto solutions. This method tends to provide a specific topic-oriented product in each version, rather than a generic product.

##### 2017.1.26
Make the roadmap based on the prioritization of viewpoints.

##### 2017.1.27
Prioritize the requirements using MoScoW method. And consider the detailed activities for each release.

##### 2017.1.28
Start bulit the release planning, document the report.

##### 2017.1.29
Still writing the release planning report.

##### 2017.1.30
Finish the release planning report, and show the challenges.
C1: How to build a right roadmap is hard for me.
C2: I am not very clearly how many release should I plan.
C3: I am not very clearly how to divide the resource for different release.

##### 2017.1.31
Log End.
