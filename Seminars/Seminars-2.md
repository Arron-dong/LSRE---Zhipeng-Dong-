##### Read up on the Boston Matrix
      Boston Matrix is a chart, the purpose of the Boston Matrix are :
      1. It can help organizations analyze their business performance.
      2. It can help company allocate resources to be more reasonable.
      3. It can help companies analyze the market.
      4. It can help companies manage products, strategic and portfolio analysis.
      Boston Matrix is actually a two by two matrix, the horizontal axis is the relative market share and the vertical axis is the market growth rate. This chart is made up of four regional sections. They are cash cows, dogs, question marks and stars. They are four different professional works.
      The cash cows - Cash Cows refers to businesses that have high market share and low expected growth. Therefore, this kind of professional work usually brings more cash income to the company than the maintenance professional work. They are generally considered to be stable and boring, because of the market is mature, so all companies want to have this kind of professional work. Companies only need to maintain the most basic expenses, they do not need to increase investment for this kind of professional work.
      The dogs - Dogs refers to businesses that have low market share and low expected growth. This kind of professional work usually could only maintain a balance of payments. While this kind of professional work may actually assist other professional works, it is useless for the company from an accounting point of view, because this kind of professional work is fail to generate significant revenue for the company. Therefore, from this point of view, this kind of professional work should be sold.
      The Question Marks - Question Marks refers to businesses that have high-growth market but low market share. Because this kind of professional work is suitable for high-growth market, so it requires a lot of investment. But because the market share is low, this kind of professional work is failed to bring considerable revenue for the company, the result is large cash outlay will outcome. This kind of professional work is very unstable, and there are a lot of risks. Therefore, before investing in this kind of professional work, a carefully analyzing is very important, we need to determine whether the investment is worth or not.
      The Stars - Stars refers to businesses that have high market share and high expected growth. This kind of professional work is expected to become the company's "cash cow" area of business. While these businesses will need to invest more money to maintain market leadership, these investments are worthwhile if the goals achieved. When the market become mature, the "Star" area of business will become a "cash cow" area of business.
      When an industry and its market matured, all companies in the industry's business will become a "cash cow" or "dog" area of business. Most of the business life cycle is from the "question mark" area, and then moved to the "star" area. When the market slows down, it moves to the "cash cow" area. Eventually it will move to the "dog" area, and complete a life cycle.

##### ----"Towards a reference framework for software product management":
           In this paper, The author presents a reference framework for software product management. This reference framwork involves many aspects, such like portfolio management, product roadmapping, release planning and requirements management. And the stakeholders and their relations has been identified in this paper.
           From this paper, we know the stakeholders can be divided into internal stakeholders and external stakeholders. The internal stakeholders including company board, the consultants of the services department, support stands and sales and marketing staffs. The external stakeholders including potential customers, competitors and analysts.
           Portfolio management: portfolio management include four main processes, they are market trend identification, product line identification, product lifecycle management and partnering and contracting, we through market trend identification to find our partners, then we will make a decision to determine the product lifecycle. We also need to set up a clear product line management in this area.
           Product roadmapping: Roadmap is a long-term planning, also known as road planning. A roadmap is a structured representation of objects over a period of time to display a development plan. Road maps are used in business for strategic planning and communications. The roadmapping is such like product line management, the roadmapping has different use in different industries, the main use in software industry is planning purposes. 
           Requirements management: Requirements management is very important in product software companies[1]. The requirements management process including requirements estimating, identifying, changing and organizing the requirements from different stakeholders. Analyzing requirements is the most important thing when we doing requirements management. Because we need to ensure that we truly understand these requirements, if we misunderstand these requirements, the whole product will be failed.
           Release planning: The release planning is start with the product requirements prioritization. At the beginning of the project, we have already set up a series of requirements for the first release, and some unimportant requirements will be  published on next release. The release planning probable using integer linear programming to analyze the stakeholders' feedback[2].  
           The main contribution of this article: 1.This paper proposes a visual reference framework for software product management. 2. This paper provided an overview of software product management. 3. This article describes the importance of software product management.
           The shortcoming of this article: 1. The description of the visual reference framework for software product management is not detailed enough, so we do not understand how to use this framwork in the real life. 2.There is no real case to prove whether it is really effective.

##### ----"Are You Biting Off More Than You Can Chew? A Case Study on Causes and Effects of Overscoping in Large-Scale Software Engineering":
           This paper based on a hypothesis, use semi-structured interviews method to investigate nine practitioners at a large, market-driven software company. And used questionnaire method to validate the results from the interviews. Through analyzing the result of interviews and questionnaire, we known the reason of overscoping is mainly caused. Because of operating in a fast- moving market driven domain and weak awareness of overall goals may lead to overscoping. \
           It is not very easy for software product managers to select features according to the highest return of investment in market driven requirements engineering. The goal of this paper was explore the influence of factors involved in overscoping of projects. In order to achieve this goal, this paper proposed three research questions. They are: 1. what causes overscoping? 2. what are the resulting effects of overscoping? 3. how may agile RE practices impact the causes and effects of overscoping? 
           Then the author used case study method for some of the data gathering. It is a qualitative research method. Next, the author through analyzing these data and interview results got conclusion. There are eight causes could cause overscoping, c1 is continuous requirement inflow, c2 is no overview of software resource availability, c3 is low DT involvemnet in early phase, c4 is requiremnets not agreed with DTs, c5 is detailed requirement spee produced upfront, c6 is unclear vision of overrall goal, c7 is weak process adherance, c8 is scope and deadline dictated. These eight causes will answer the research question 1. For research question 2, we get the response: 1. Many requirement changes after the project scope is set. 2. Quality issues, the quality of software was negatively affected by overscoping. 3. Delays, customers' requirements changed will cause project delaied. 4.  The customers' expectations are not always met. 5. Communication gaps, distrust and unreliable will produce communication gaps. 6. Challenge to keep the SRS updated, because of overscoping, a high workload and many later requirements changed, it will increase the challenge of keeping the SRS updated. For research question 3, we known that there is less descoping than the previous phase based process.

##### ----"An industrial survey of requirements interdependencies in software product release planning":
           In this paper, The author proposed the requirements are not singular, requirements may depend on each other in the real world. Because of this reason, select requirements for the next release of a sofrware system is very difficult. At first, this paper examines the interdependence of 20 requirements for five different products in five different companies. Then this paper presents the research results: 1. Most requirements are depend on each other. 2. Only a few requirements are singular. 3. Bespoke development products will include much more functionality-related dependencies. 
           This paper focus on requirements interactions from a release planning perspective. In this paper, the author select five different cases to achieve the survey. The first case is a small company with one product and services associated with it. The product is mature, and the staffs have a high experienced in requirements management. Case two is a medium sized company with three different product areas. The product is also mature, and the requiremnet manager has a high experienced in requirements management. Case three is a large company, the product is mature, and the requiremnet manager has a high experienced in requirements management. Case four is a software engineering research institute, the requiremnet manager has a high experienced in requirements management. Case five is a medium sized company, try to achieve specific customers' requirements, and the requiremnet manager has a high experienced in requirements management.
           For each case, the author used same method to collect the data to find different types of interdependencies. And then analysis these data to get results.
           From this paper, we known the release planning is a very important part of market-driven software development process. The release planning can decide what should be delivered when. In an ideal situation, where there are no interdependencies between requirements, we could select a number of priority requirements, depending on the release planning. But in fact, only about 20% of the requirements are singular, so in order to dealing with requirements interdependencies, a simple visualization technique has been published. This visualization technique could identify of both singular requirements, and highly dependent requirements. 
           At last, the author compared the issue of interdependencies among requirements as well as between partitions of a set of requirements.
           The main contribution of this article: 1. This paper proposed a classification scheme for interdependen, such like: AND, REQUIRES, ICOST, CVALUE. 2. This paper proposed a simple visualization technique, it is very useful for supporting reasons about possible of partitioning a set of requirements. 3. From this paper, we known that considering requirements interdependencies is very important in software product release planning.
           The shortcoming of this article: 1. This paper does not explain, how to deal with the collected data and the reason of why select these data. 2. In this paper, the author did not related the issue of requirements interdependencies to that of dependencies between requirements and the code base.
           The main contribution of this article: 1. This article provides a detailed picture of factors involved in overscoping and confirms. 2. We know the main reasons for overscoping, it is dealing with fast moving market driven domain and manage inflow of requirements. We known a situation of overscoping may cause even more overscoping, so we need to pay more attention on the overscoping.
           The shortcoming of this article: 1. This article did not talk more about how the agile RE practices affect overscoping. 2. The research object of this paper is too single, so the generalisability of findings are not strengthen.
