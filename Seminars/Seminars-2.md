      The cash cows - Cash Cows refers to businesses that have high market share and low expected growth. Therefore, this kind of professional work usually brings more cash income to the company than the maintenance professional work. They are generally considered to be stable and boring, because of the market is mature, so all companies want to have this kind of professional work. Companies only need to maintain the most basic expenses, they do not need to increase investment for this kind of professional work.
      The dogs - Dogs refers to businesses that have low market share and low expected growth. This kind of professional work usually could only maintain a balance of payments. While this kind of professional work may actually assist other professional works, it is useless for the company from an accounting point of view, because this kind of professional work is fail to generate significant revenue for the company. Therefore, from this point of view, this kind of professional work should be sold.
      The Question Marks - Question Marks refers to businesses that have high-growth market but low market share. Because this kind of professional work is suitable for high-growth market, so it requires a lot of investment. But because the market share is low, this kind of professional work is failed to bring considerable revenue for the company, the result is large cash outlay will outcome. This kind of professional work is very unstable, and there are a lot of risks. Therefore, before investing in this kind of professional work, a carefully analyzing is very important, we need to determine whether the investment is worth or not.
      The Stars - Stars refers to businesses that have high market share and high expected growth. This kind of professional work is expected to become the company's "cash cow" area of business. While these businesses will need to invest more money to maintain market leadership, these investments are worthwhile if the goals achieved. When the market become mature, the "Star" area of business will become a "cash cow" area of business.
      When an industry and its market matured, all companies in the industry's business will become a "cash cow" or "dog" area of business. Most of the business life cycle is from the "question mark" area, and then moved to the "star" area. When the market slows down, it moves to the "cash cow" area. Eventually it will move to the "dog" area, and complete a life cycle.
