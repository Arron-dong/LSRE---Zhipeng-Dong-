##### Read up on the Boston Matrix
      Boston Matrix is a chart, the purpose of the Boston Matrix are :
      1. It can help organizations analyze their business performance.
      2. It can help company allocate resources to be more reasonable.
      3. It can help companies analyze the market.
      4. It can help companies manage products, strategic and portfolio analysis.
      Boston Matrix is actually a two by two matrix, the horizontal axis is the relative market share and the vertical axis is the market growth rate. This chart is made up of four regional sections. They are cash cows, dogs, question marks and stars. They are four different professional works.
      The cash cows - Cash Cows refers to businesses that have high market share and low expected growth. Therefore, this kind of professional work usually brings more cash income to the company than the maintenance professional work. They are generally considered to be stable and boring, because of the market is mature, so all companies want to have this kind of professional work. Companies only need to maintain the most basic expenses, they do not need to increase investment for this kind of professional work.
      The dogs - Dogs refers to businesses that have low market share and low expected growth. This kind of professional work usually could only maintain a balance of payments. While this kind of professional work may actually assist other professional works, it is useless for the company from an accounting point of view, because this kind of professional work is fail to generate significant revenue for the company. Therefore, from this point of view, this kind of professional work should be sold.
      The Question Marks - Question Marks refers to businesses that have high-growth market but low market share. Because this kind of professional work is suitable for high-growth market, so it requires a lot of investment. But because the market share is low, this kind of professional work is failed to bring considerable revenue for the company, the result is large cash outlay will outcome. This kind of professional work is very unstable, and there are a lot of risks. Therefore, before investing in this kind of professional work, a carefully analyzing is very important, we need to determine whether the investment is worth or not.
      The Stars - Stars refers to businesses that have high market share and high expected growth. This kind of professional work is expected to become the company's "cash cow" area of business. While these businesses will need to invest more money to maintain market leadership, these investments are worthwhile if the goals achieved. When the market become mature, the "Star" area of business will become a "cash cow" area of business.
      When an industry and its market matured, all companies in the industry's business will become a "cash cow" or "dog" area of business. Most of the business life cycle is from the "question mark" area, and then moved to the "star" area. When the market slows down, it moves to the "cash cow" area. Eventually it will move to the "dog" area, and complete a life cycle.

##### ----"Towards a reference framework for software product management":
           In this paper, The author presents a reference framework for software product management. This reference framwork involves many aspects, such like portfolio management, product roadmapping, release planning and requirements management. And the stakeholders and their relations has been identified in this paper.
           From this paper, we know the stakeholders can be divided into internal stakeholders and external stakeholders. The internal stakeholders including company board, the consultants of the services department, support stands and sales and marketing staffs. The external stakeholders including potential customers, competitors and analysts.
           Portfolio management: portfolio management include four main processes, they are market trend identification, product line identification, product lifecycle management and partnering and contracting, we through market trend identification to find our partners, then we will make a decision to determine the product lifecycle. We also need to set up a clear product line management in this area.
           Product roadmapping: Roadmap is a long-term planning, also known as road planning. A roadmap is a structured representation of objects over a period of time to display a development plan. Road maps are used in business for strategic planning and communications. The roadmapping is such like product line management, the roadmapping has different use in different industries, the main use in software industry is planning purposes. 
           Requirements management: Requirements management is very important in product software companies[1]. The requirements management process including requirements estimating, identifying, changing and organizing the requirements from different stakeholders. Analyzing requirements is the most important thing when we doing requirements management. Because we need to ensure that we truly understand these requirements, if we misunderstand these requirements, the whole product will be failed.
           Release planning: The release planning is start with the product requirements prioritization. At the beginning of the project, we have already set up a series of requirements for the first release, and some unimportant requirements will be  published on next release. The release planning probable using integer linear programming to analyze the stakeholders' feedback[2].  
           The main contribution of this article: 1.This paper proposes a visual reference framework for software product management. 2. This paper provided an overview of software product management. 3. This article describes the importance of software product management.
           The shortcoming of this article: 1. The description of the visual reference framework for software product management is not detailed enough, so we do not understand how to use this framwork in the real life. 2.There is no real case to prove whether it is really effective.
