#### The first part: Seminar Discussions

##### • Requirements (classic/bespoke)
##### – What is a requirement?
        A requirement is something what users want to get. Meet the requirements of users, is an important way to improve customer satisfaction[1].
        A requirement is relate to all the phases of the product, such like product analysis, design, development, test and so on.
        In software requirement engineering, we know that the requirement is divide in to 2 parts. The first part is the functional requirements and the second part is the non-functional requirements[1].
        Requirement is constantly changing and updating in market-driven software product development[2].
        Requirements analysis is a very important process in software engineering. In software engineering, if you do not consider the requirements, then the customer's needs will not be met, the result is the software can not be completed in the specified time.
##### – What is a good requirement?
        A good requirement should have a more comprehensive system requirements management document.
        A good requirement should meet different user groups, such as users of different ages, different gender users, users of different educational levels, living in different geographical locations[3].
        A good requirement should be clear and well-proven[4].
        A good requirement not only to meet the needs of users, but also to meet the requirements of various stakeholders.
##### – How do you write them?
        1. Each requirement must have a unique number.
        2. Each requirement must have a detail analysis and interpretation.
        3. We need to prioritize all the requirements, according to the sorted results to write them.
##### – How do you get them?
        Getting requirements is an easy and complex thing, It is easy to find the simple requirements, but it is difficult to find the complex requiremnets.
        There are lots of methods to obtaining the requirements:
        1.Qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis method.
        2.User interviews.
        3.Questionnaire method.
        4.Observation and user diary analysis method.
##### – What do you do with them?
        First, we use different methods to obtain the requirements. Then we summarized the different requirements. Third, We set up a standard requirements document and we use interview and questionnaire method to verify if these requirements are correct or not. Finally, we create a clear requirements update document to manage the requirements updata. 

#### • Requirements (large scale)
##### – How do you group them?




##### – How do you store them?





##### – How do you deal with them?







##### – Where do you get them?








##### – How do you connect quality requirements into the mix?
